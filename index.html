    <h1>Watership Down</h1>
    <h2>Written by Richard Adams</h2>
    <h3>Book Details:</h3>
    <p>Watership Down was written in 2022.<br /> Here are the different entries below for the characters. Also the intro is helpful for showing how the book started and giving the setting and main conflict throughout the book. The various entries relate to some of the key events in the story. These events are important to the plot and how the story rolls out. However, some information is not specified as it is a 500 page book and including all the details would be a daunting task at best.</p>
