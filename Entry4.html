    <h1>The Bird: (Written from perspective of Bigwig)</h1>
    <p>I followed Hazel and brought back the worms. Hazel told me that there was a bird that I should see. The bird ate up the worms, but I didn't understand what was happening. Why were we giving this to the bird? However, I trusted that Hazel would tell me what was happening. Hazel explained why the bird was necessary for our trip, but I was going to have to wait for now. We started to make the burrow that we would all fit in it as a place to live. Hopefully it will turn out well, and we will be able to make it so it is large enough for what we need. We kept digging the hole, but we knew it would be a long time before we would finish the entire thing. For now, we will wait. However, I knew that it would take a long time to dig, but I didnâ€™t know how long it would take. After this constant movement we realized that we might have to do things like this multiple times. Things were not going to be easy, and we would have to deal with what happened. However, we all hoped that eventually everything would smooth out after all this madness.</p>
