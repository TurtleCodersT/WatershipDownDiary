    <h1>Hazel's Death (From prespective of Blackberry)</h1>
    <p>Suddenly as we were running away trying to find a way out, we heard more gunshots. After we finally found our safe refuge, we realized that we could not find Hazel. Instantly, everyone began to worry, and I realized something. Hazel might not be here with us anymore after the gunshots. Then, I realized my suspicions were right as I heard Dandelion say how Hazel was shot. This made me very sad, but I kept this to myself. However, I still had hope as I knew that Hazel would still try to come to us. If Hazel came, then not all might be lost. Then Speedwell, who was another rabbit with us, said that he might not be dead even after being shot. So, it gave us more hope for what may come. However, after I found out the truth, my sadness could fill a river with tears. We waited a long time and after we were on the way to move on, the truth was confirmed. Hazel was dead. When I looked around everyone felt the same way. Everyone was sad and in despair. However, we would have to move on as a group to continue going. We have already made so much progress, so we need to just keep going. However, all of us knew that doing it was easier said than done.</p>
