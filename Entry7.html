    <h1>Grief (From perspective of Holly)</h1>
    <p>By now it has been a moment since Hazel died. However, I wasn't sure how long it would take me to stop thinking as much about it. I tried to reassure the other rabbits that it would be okay, but I could tell they weren't really paying attention. However, even I realized that there might not be much hope. I am the one who usually has hope. We never know what will happen next. Could someone else perish, or will we continue on fine? It was all dependent on a factor of luck, something I wasn't very fond of. The luck could go completely out of our favor without us having any control. We all felt a little hopeless, feeling like there was nothing to be done now. We were all left with almost nothing. How could ANYONE find any hope in this? Since we all knew what was happening, it was not too surprising. We knew at some point that someone might die from something. However, how could it be this soon? Our journey is not too far in, and we already have this. I can feel our hope as a burrow diminishing. Before long, our hope might be zero.</p>
