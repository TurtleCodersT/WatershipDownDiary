    <h1>Entry 5: Perspective of Dandelion</h1>
    <p>Suddenly, I heard Bigwig shout to leave and move away. At first, I wondered what was going on. However, soon I realized what was actually happening. There was a dog who had woken up after we broke into the barn. We were just trying to go inside the barn, but it did not take long for the dog to wake up. Bigwig then screamed in my ear that I must move now so I mustn't get killed. Eventually the sound of barking began to panic me because of how startling it was. I hesitated for a minute before finally joining Bigwig and the others. We did not successfully get the four rabbits that we wanted because they wouldn't move. Suddenly, I zoned out and began to think about other things. What would have happened if we didn't make it out? If there was a rabbit left behind, how would we recover? Would this journey continue to be as hard as it had been throughout the entire trip? These questions would be answered soon, I would just have to wait until I got the answer. Sometimes I must realize that not everything can be predicted perfectly because there is the variable of chance. After I finally returned to the conversation, once again the others began to scream. This is because people had arrived, which was a disaster. We all knew that we were way smaller than humans as rabbits, but at this point it was bad. It was possible that they could just step on us without even knowing. As we ran away, I began to think about how many more times things like these could happen.</p>
