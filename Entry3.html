    <h1>Doubts: Fiver (Relates to all other characters) </h1>
    <p>Why did we sign up for this journey that is so hard? Was Fiver really right? Or did we just get tricked into going on this pointless journey? It is hard to say, but we wish it was easier. Maybe we should turn back? No, we have already come too far for that. It will be a long journey home to get back to where we started our journey. I guess we will have to see what happens. For now, I will see everyone later. It is so hard every day, and it almost seems pointless. Will we really make it to our destination? What will happen? Will someone get injured on the way there or will we enjoy the journey and the destination? It will probably not get easier. However, if it does, when will that happen? Millions of questions filled our heads, and it was like a balloon floating inside our minds, kicking from the inside. It was very hard. But would we succeed? If so, what would happen? What was the point of all this, if no one else believes us? It was hard to imagine what the future might look like even just a month from now. There are also so many creatures larger than us that can easily crush us. We will all have to work together on this.</p>
