    <p>Why would they leave? Fiver says that there is a great danger, but how would he know? Even if they leave, I am not going to. They are just assuming something that will not happen for sure. Well, anyway I will just wait for them to come back and see that they were truly wrong and that there was not any danger to begin with. I know the others will leave, but should I? Either way it will probably not end up an issue. Well, that is it for today.</p>
