    <p>Suddenly I heard Bigwig telling me of the plan to escape Efrafa. No one had been able to escape so far because everyone was blocked in. However, I was hoping that Bigwig was right. The problem was I needed to make sure that Bigwig was not lying or a spy. After confirming everything, I continued on and got ready for the plan. I realized that it might not be as easy as it seemed. However, there were going to be other rabbits with me.</p>
