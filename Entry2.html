    <h1>Entry 2: Fiver</h1>
    <p>Suddenly as I was running, I screamed. A crow tried to attack me, and of course with us all being rabbits that could have been a problem. Hazel and Pipkin looked at me in wonder at what happened to make me scream. However, luckily what did happen was not too serious. Just as the crow flew by, I barely dodged it. We moved on and realized that everything will be fine, but after all the hardships so far, we begin to doubt that. There are many larger creatures than us that can easily kill us, so we need to be careful. I was worried about what may come next because you never know what challenges await you. There could always be trouble and things that may happen to you any minute.</p>
