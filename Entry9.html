    <h1>The Battle (Thunder's Perspective)</h1>
    <p>After we had escaped from Efrafa we had the last fight with General Woundwort. We were in our burrow when the General came. However, we were expecting this for a while. After we had escaped, the General found out we knew that we were in trouble. The General was mad, so we tried to make a treaty. Since in Efrafa you were trapped there, we tried to establish a burrow for both Efrafa and us. However, after we sent a rabbit in the form of a peace offering, General Woundwort declined our offering. I realized that eventually the rabbits in the army of Efrafa would come for us. We came up with a plan to protect the other rabbits. Eventually after the plan was finalized, we began to put it into action. After the General tried to break into our burrow, we fled. However, suddenly a dog escaped which we knew could be deadly for us rabbits. Since we were so small compared to the dogs it could be very bad. I ran away in fear and so did the others. However, when we came back, I found out that the General was nowhere to be found. We all wondered where the General went. After we found the General, we were informed that the General had perished. This put an end to the fighting and created peace between us. Now we could have peace between Efrafa and us.</p>
